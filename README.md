# evanwolf.co

Website built using Create React App v 2.0+ and is hosted on the App Engine by Google Cloud Platform.

Plans for this site include: a detailed about page with my background, a section for viewing completed projects, scrolling, contact and links to linkedin and GitHub.

## Jan 7 ##
Currently displaying just a stock image and some text. Still working to implement current versions of packages necessary to run the application.

## Jan 10 ##
The application architecture and documentation (which is my favorite part) are just about done. The biggest problem right now is getting depreciated modules to work with React 16+ or replace them with newer libraries/functions that work the same.

### Finished parts: ###
Layout of the homepage
Persistent NavBar component
Projects (placeholder)
When in view transition using react waypoint.

### Still to be done: ###
About
Styling
Debugging & rerouting
Hosting/GCP

## Jan 11 ##
Far from done, but I am for now.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
